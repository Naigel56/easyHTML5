# easyHTML5

easyHTML5 is a legacy framework developed to simplify the adoption of a MVC-like pattern in OO web application development.

### History

It all started back in 2012 while I was writing [my master's thesis](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/67181) at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/). It was clear that web applications were going to be more and more widespread, thus replacing a number of desktop applications. The idea of this project was to demonstrate the possibility of using an easy pure Javascript representation of model objects, delegating to a library the responsibility to handle both data consistency and data visualization.

### Today

Nowadays we see lots of client-side frameworks able to maintain data consistency, like Angular and React. They let developers implement the View in a flexible way, something that easyHTML5 allows only partially. This could be considered a severe limitation by today's standards.

### Developments

Back in 2012, it made sense to try to expand this library. The idea was to make it more flexible by taking an approach similar to [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/)'s data binding. After this step, we wanted to add a comprehensive documentation and a rich set of examples, hoping to involve the open source community and obtain some feedback. 

### Resources

Here on GitHub you can find the last stable version of the client-side easyHTML5.js library (0.6.1).  
Sadly, examples and documentation are not available on the original sources anymore. Soon I will port and translate in English the existing examples so that they can be accessible on [Jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), and the documentation will be available on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/). Meanwhile you can find some basic docs in the "docs" folder. Here are other references:
